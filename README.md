# Machine Learning Tutorials

The AIML group at NCAR has decided to develop introductory tutorials that make use of a subset of the GECKO-A dataset. "The Generator of Explicit Chemistry and Kinetics of Organics in the Atmosphere (GECKO-A) is a hyper-explicit mechanism for the atmospheric oxidation of organic compounds." Aersolized organic compounds play a role in weather processes like cloud formation and other weather related events. Being able to input accurate atmospheric chemistry data into a weather model could help improve that model, but current explicit mechanisms for outputing accurate atmospheric chemical data are far too computationally expensive to incorporate into weather models. The permutations of reactions of VOC's entering the atmosphere quickly amount to millions of reactants and substituents. You can find more information on the GECKO-A mechanism [here.](https://www2.acom.ucar.edu/modeling/gecko). 

This series will be broken down into 7 components of Machine Learning:

* Gathering Data

* Preparing Data

* Choosing a model

* Training Data

* Evaluating that model

* Tuning parameters

* Prediction

These tutorials will make the assumption that the user has Python programming experience and a basic understanding of such computer science concepts as data structures.

In notebook 1 we will go over gathering data, preparing data, and conducting an initial inspection and visual exploration of our data.
